# CNNMicroscopy
Convolutional Neural Networks based Super-resolution Microscopy

This repository is a collection of various Deep Learning algorithms implemented using the TensorFlow library. This package is intended as a command line utility you can use to quickly train and evaluate popular Deep Learning models and maybe use them as benchmark/baseline in comparison to your custom models/datasets. If you want to use the package from ipython or maybe integrate it in your code, I published a pip package named yadlt: Yet Another Deep Learning Tool.
